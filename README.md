## Project Overview

Project created as part of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree.
In this project, a static webpage that lacks accessibility is given to be converted into a mobile-ready web application. The design  was made responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Service Worker was also added to create a seamless offline (and Lie-fi) experience for the users.

## How to Run

Application can be run using the following steps

1. Run locally
* Clone the project:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/Yawmiej/Restaurant-Review-App.git
    ```

* In this folder, set up an HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`or open index.html.

2. Application is also available online [here](https://yawmiej.github.io/Restaurant-Review-App/)
